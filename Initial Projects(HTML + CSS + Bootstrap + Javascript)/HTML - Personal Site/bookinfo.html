    <strong><h3>About Book</h3></strong>
    <p>This book has been totally written to create a hoax among students who think “rattofying(cramming)” this book can do wonders. A writer who has worked in Amazon and some hot questions - what else? No, there is nothings great with the theory part and all the questions from the book are available on so many websites that there can be an integer overflow if you start counting. This book will help with nothing. Period. This book does not help you understand the basics nor does it explain anything in detail.</p>
